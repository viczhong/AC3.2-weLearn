# AC3.2-weLearn

When weLearn, everyone wins!

WeLearn is a clutter-free resource management app that allows instructors to easily set up a lesson plan and students to share resources. Each class is powered under the hood by a template of 7 Google Sheets (ranging from Student Roster to Lesson Schedule w/ Github links), and weLearn distills that info to every student in real time.

We designed weLearn as a mobile learning management system (LMS), to directly address our needs as students in a tech fellowship. At C4Q, we use email and Slack to keep connected. Slack is an amazing piece of technology, but the chat-room format makes it so easy for important links, grades, and announcements to get lost in the mix. weLearn is here to help!

On the backend, instructors use Google Sheets templates to upload grades, assignments, and announcements. They can even reward students with special achievement badges. This fosters a lively classroom culture and encourages students to strive.

In the future, we hope to implement push notifications, so students can be updated on the go, annotated audio/video recording of lessons similar to Soundcloud's format, and a fully integrated instructor-facing UI.
