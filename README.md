# AC3.2-weLearn

WeLearn! WeLearn is a clutter-free resource management app that allows instructors to easily set up a lesson plan and students to share resources. Each class is powered under the hood by a template of 7 Google Sheets (ranging from Student Roster to Lesson Schedule w/ Github links), and weLearn filters that info to every student in real time.
