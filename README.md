# weLearn

WeLearn is a clutter-free resource management app that allows instructors to easily set up a lesson plan and students to share resources. Each class is powered under the hood by a template of 7 Google Sheets (ranging from Student Roster to Lesson Schedule w/ Github links), and weLearn distills that info to every student in every class in real time.

In our experience with email and Slack make it so easy for important links, grades, and announcements to get lost in the mix. weLearn is here to help by being a trove of information.

On the backend, instructors use Google Sheets templates to upload grades, assignments, and announcements. They can even reward students with special achievement badges. This fosters a lively classroom culture and encourages students to strive.
